Gloria-theos is a react Three JS scene of marble art with lights, shadows, materials, orbit controls and stats.
Technical stack : React JS / TypeScript / Three JS / fiber / drei / JEST - RTL / CRA / CSS / ESLint.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

All screen size are handled, working in all browsers.

For the deployement I built the project with the `yarn build` commande and I deployed with Firebase, here the documentation for hosting and deploying your app in Firebase : https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart.
